This repository contains the files companion to the preprints:

**\[B20\]** F. Brunault, [On the K4 group of modular curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07614)

The file `K4.gp` contains PARI/GP code to compute numerically the regulators of certain $K_4$ classes on the modular curve $Y_1(N)$. To use it, you should start PARI/GP in the directory containing the file `K4.gp` and the data files `DataH1ell` and `DataH1`. Then type the command

```
\r K4.gp
```

The beginning of the file `K4.gp` explains several examples of use.

**\[B23\]** F. Brunault, [On the Mahler measure of (1+x)(1+y)+z]()

The file `K4-modular-complex.gp` contains a (partial) PARI/GP implementation of the weight $3$ modular complex $\mathcal{C}_N(3)$, introduced in Section 3 of \[B23\]. This program is used in Section 4 of the same paper. The beginning of the file `K4-modular-complex.gp` explains how to reproduce this computation and how the program can be used more generally. To use the program, you should start PARI/GP in the directory containing the file `K4-modular-complex.gp`, and then type the command

```
\r K4-modular-complex.gp
```

The file `K4-reg-Lvalue.gp` contains a PARI/GP program to compute in exact form the Goncharov regulator of the classes $\xi(a,b)$ on $Y(N)$ introduced in \[B20\]. This program is used in Section 6 of \[B23\]. The beginning of the file `K4-reg-Lvalue.gp` explains how to reproduce this computation and how the program can be used more generally. To use the program, you should start PARI/GP in the directory containing the file `K4-modular-complex.gp`, and then type the command

```
\r K4-reg-Lvalue.gp
```

The SageMath notebook `ModularSymbolGamma15.ipynb` contains computations with modular symbols used in Section 5 of \[B23\].
